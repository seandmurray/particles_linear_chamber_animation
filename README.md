# Problem: Animation

If you are using a machine with a bash shell (Linux/Mac) there is a *run.sh* in each project directory to make running a sample, simple.

"npm test" will run the local tests.

**All scripts/commands should be run from within the respective project directory!**

A collection of particles is contained in a linear chamber. They all have the same speed,
but some are headed toward the right and others are headed toward the left. These
particles can pass through each other without disturbing the motion of the particles, so
all the particles will leave the chamber relatively quickly.
You will be given the initial conditions by a string 'init' containing at each position an 'L'
for a leftward moving particle, an 'R' for a rightward moving particle, or a '.' for an empty
location. 'init' shows all the positions in the chamber. Initially, no location in the chamber
contains two particles passing through each other.
We would like an animation of the particles as they move. At each unit of time, we want
a string showing occupied locations with an 'X' and unoccupied locations with a '.'.
Create a method 'animate' that takes a positive integer 'speed' and a string 'init' giving
the initial conditions. The speed is the number of positions each particle moves in one
unit of time. The method will return an array of strings in which each successive element
shows the occupied locations at each time step. The first element of the return should

show the occupied locations at the initial instant (at time = 0) in the 'X', '.' format. The
last element in the return should show the empty chamber at the first time that it
becomes empty.

Again, imagine that the method you write will be called thousands of times for varying
initial conditions with size ranging from 0 to 50, and also imagine the case when init is
several hundred thousand locations in size (though with speed > size / 20 or so). Try to
handle both of these cases efficiently in your implementation.

## Examples:

(Note that in the examples below, the double quotes should not be considered part of the input or output strings.)

```bash
0) 2, "..R...."
Returns:
{ "..X....",
"....X..",
"......X",
"......." }
The single particle starts at the 3rd position, moves to the 5th, then 7th, and then out of
the chamber.
1) 3, "RR..LRL"
Returns:
{ "XX..XXX",
".X.XX..",
"X.....X",
"......." }
Note that, at the first time step after init, there are actually 4 particles in the chamber,
but two are passing through each other at the 4th position
2) 2, "LRLR.LRLR"
Returns:
{ "XXXX.XXXX",
"X..X.X..X",
".X.X.X.X.",
".X.....X.",
"........." }
At time 0 (init) there are 8 particles. At time 1, there are still 6 particles, but only 4
positions are occupied since particles are passing through each other.
3) 10, "RLRLRLRLRL"

Returns:
{ "XXXXXXXXXX",
".........." }
These particles are moving so fast that they all exit the chamber by time 1.
4) 1, "..."
Returns:
{ "..." }
5) 1, "LRRL.LR.LRR.R.LRRL."
Returns:
{ "XXXX.XX.XXX.X.XXXX.",
"..XXX..X..XX.X..XX.",
".X.XX.X.X..XX.XX.XX",
"X.X.XX...X.XXXXX..X",
".X..XXX...X..XX.X..",
"X..X..XX.X.XX.XX.X.",
"..X....XX..XX..XX.X",
".X.....XXXX..X..XX.",
"X.....X..XX...X..XX",
".....X..X.XX...X..X",
"....X..X...XX...X..",
"...X..X.....XX...X.",
"..X..X.......XX...X",
".X..X.........XX...",
"X..X...........XX..",
"..X.............XX.",
".X...............XX",
"X.................X",
"..................." }
```
